# Understanding TikTok Reviews

The goal of this project was to examine reviews of the video streaming app TikTok to analyze sentiment and discover what people discuss in the reviews. The data came from a Kaggle dataset that covers 3.5 million reviews from 2015 through 2021. I performed NLP through spacy to tokenize the data and then I explored multiple topic models including LSA, NMF, LDA, and CoRex to discover what topics were being discussed and whether the sentiment was primarily positive or negative. This goal was best achieved through a CoRex topic model, discovering 4 major topics centered on True Reviews, Requests, Positive Sentiment, and Content that is enjoyed by users.
