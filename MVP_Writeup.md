# Early Findings

With the current data set I decided to limit the number of reviews down to ones that come from 2020 to present, as those are going to be more representative of TikTok's current state and may reflect the state of affairs more accurately and provide a more palpable sentiment analysis.
With this it whittled down the number of reviews from 3.5 million to 1.9 million, and have processed these through spacy and created a cleaner number of tokens.
With LSA I found these 10 topics from the top 25 words:

It is clear to me that these topics have a clear ton of overlap and the next step is to do more text processing and cleaning to remove words that are used to an excessive degree.
